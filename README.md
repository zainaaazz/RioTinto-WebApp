# RioTinto-App

Blazor WebAssembly App with an Azure SQL Database for a system to track the impact of community initiatives

The mining company’s involvement in local socioeconomic development is limited. There is little support for education, skills training, or job creation, resulting in weak connections with the community and limited local economic growth.
# Target Objective
Create a community investment strategy that strengthens local ties and supports sustainable development. The strategy should:

•	Conduct a needs assessment to identify community priorities, such as education or infrastructure improvements. Highlight what a good needs assessment is and how this will look like [research Simandou as per the target area]

•	Develop programs for job creation and skills training that align with local needs and available resources.

•	Establish a system for tracking the impact of community initiatives to ensure long-term benefits.
