<h2>Nzérékoré, Guinea</h2>

<p>
    Nzérékoré is Guinea's second-largest city and a key commercial and economic hub in the southeastern region. The city is culturally diverse, with various ethnic groups contributing to a rich blend of traditions and languages. The local economy is primarily driven by agriculture, commerce, handicrafts, and small to medium-sized enterprises.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Road infrastructure is underdeveloped, with many unpaved roads that are difficult to navigate, especially during the rainy season, hindering transportation and trade.</li>
    <li>Nzérékoré has benefited from the CLSG interconnection project, which has improved electricity supply for residents and businesses.</li>
    <li>Other infrastructure, such as healthcare, education, and sanitation, still requires significant development to meet population demands.</li>
    <li>Despite challenges, Nzérékoré remains a vibrant cultural and economic center in the region.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges faced by the community</h2>

<h3>Poverty and Inequality</h3>

 <ul>
    <li>43% of Guinean households live below the poverty line, with rural areas, women, and those without education being disproportionately affected.</li>

    <li>Income inequality is stark, with the richest 10% earning 42% of total income while the bottom 50% earn only 17%.</li>
    
</ul>

<h3>Limited Access to Education</h3>

    <p>Guinea has low public spending on education compared to Sub-Saharan and other low-income countries, contributing to a lack of educational opportunities and perpetuating inequality.</p>

<h3>Economic Dependence on Mining</h3>

<p>The economy is heavily reliant on mining, which accounts for 21% of GDP and over 90% of exports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.</p>
